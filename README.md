PANCAKE is an algorithm-driven application focused on optimal route planning for resource collection tasks. The system receives a demand list, which includes a set of required items, goods, or objectives that must be acquired during a patrol or outing. The goal is to identify the most efficient path through a graph-based map to collect all required items while minimizing cost or distance.  



In this project, each node in the map represents a location such as a shop or supply station where various items can be acquired. A single node may offer multiple items, each with associated value and cost. This reflects real-world scenarios where one stop may fulfill several needs. The challenge lies in intelligently selecting which nodes to visit—and in what order—to optimize the path and fulfill all demands.  


To solve this, PANCAKE implements a variety of algorithmic strategies :   

* Basic algorithms
* **Heuristic **algorithms****  ,  including :
  * *Genetic Algorithms*
  * *Ant Colony Optimization*
  * *Fox  Optimization Algorithm*

The project is a blend of combinatorial optimization and intelligent pathfinding, designed to explore algorithm efficiency and real-world applicability in logistics-style scenarios.
