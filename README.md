PANCAKE is an algorithm-driven application focused on optimal route planning for resource collection tasks. The system receives a demand list, which includes a set of required items, goods, or objectives that must be acquired during a patrol or outing. The goal is to identify the most efficient path through a graph-based map to collect all required items while minimizing cost or distance.  
  
In this project, each node in the map represents a location such as a shop or supply station where various items can be acquired. A single node may offer multiple items, each with associated value and cost. This reflects real-world scenarios where one stop may fulfill several needs. The challenge lies in intelligently selecting which nodes to visit—and in what order—to optimize the path and fulfill all demands.
